CacheHash
=========

An efficient C hash table data structure that supports a limited number of
hash table items and evicts the least recently used object (with a callback)
on insertion. This is accomplished with a Judy Array where hash table items
point to an statically allocated doubly-linked-list where head is MRU object
and tail is LRU. On object access, object is moved to the head of the list.

This is primarily intended for caches. 

API
===

Initialization::

	typedef void (*cachehash_evict_cb)(void* key, size_t keylen, void *data) 
	*cachehash cachehash_init(size_t maxitems, cachehash_evict_cb *cb)

Has Item? (returns item without rearranging)::

	void* cachehash_has(cachehash *ch, void *key, size_t key_len)

Get Item! (returns item and moves to be MRU object)::

	void* cachehash_get(cachehash *ch, void *key, size_t key_len)

Put Item! (adds an item to the cachehash)::

	void* cachehash_put(cachehash *ch, void *key, size_t key_len, void *value)
	
Evict Item! (evicts LRU item if the cachehash is full)::

	void* cachehash_evict_if_full(cachehash *ch)
	
Free Cache Hash (frees all memory used by data structure)::

	void cachehash_free(cachehash *ch, cachehash_process_cb *cb);
	
Iterate (call callback for each item in hash table from MRU -> LRU order)::

	void cachehash_iter(cachehash *ch, cachehash_process_cb *cb);
	
Debug Print (print out entire data structure assuming that keys and values are null-terminated strings)::

	void cachehash_debug_dump(cachehash *ch);

Example
=======

A quick example::

	include <cachehash.h>
	ch = cachehash_init(5, NULL);
	
	char *key = "test-key";
	char *value = "test-value";
	cachehash_put(ch, key, strlen(key), value);
	
	printf("value of has is %s\n", cachehash_has(ch, key, strlen(key)));
	assert(cachehash_has(ch, key, strlen(key)) == value);
	
	cachehash_free(ch, NULL);


Dependencies
============

CacheHash uses Judy Arrays (http://judy.sourceforge.net/) for its backend hash table.
This can generally be installed using your operating system's package manager. For example,
you need to run `sudo apt-get install libjudy-dev` on Debian-based systems.
